    "consentFormText": "We are asking you to be in a research study. This form gives you information to help you decide whether or not to be in the study. Being in the study is voluntary. Please read this carefully. You may ask any questions about the study. Then you can decide whether or not you want to be in the study.\n\nThis form also serves as an assent form for individuals ages 13-17. This means that if you choose to take part in this research study, you would sign this form to confirm your choice. Your parent or legally-authorized representative would also need to give their permission and sign this form for you to join the study.\n\nThis form is also used for parents and legally-authorized representatives of subjects to provide permission to the research team for individuals who are not capable of providing permission themselves. In such cases, the term “you” refers to the subject or your child.\n\n**PURPOSE OF THE STUDY**\n\nColds are common in children and adults, and can cause a runny nose, cough, or trouble breathing. We want to understand how people get sick with these cold germs and how they spread from person to person. Once we understand how the germs start and spread, we can have a better plan to prevent them from making people sick.\n\n**STUDY PROCEDURES**\n\nWe are testing children and adults who might have a cold. We are inviting you to participate because you have the symptoms of a cold. This study involves:\n\n1. Answering questions about your health, who you are around, and your living situation. We think these questions will take about 15 minutes. You may choose not to answer any question that you do not want to.\n2. Doing a swab of your nose to look for germs. This will only take about 5 seconds.\n\nThis study does not replace care you would receive from your doctor, and your participation is voluntary. The only test for this study is the swab of your nose.\n\n**RISKS, STRESS, OR DISCOMFORT**\n\nWe do not expect serious side effects from this study. Getting the nasal swab may cause mild discomfort, watery eyes, or sneezing. Some of the questions that we might ask you are sensitive and may make you feel uncomfortable. You do not have to answer any question that you do not want to. There is a risk that your privacy could be breached. We will do everything that we can to make sure that this does not happen.\n\n**BENEFITS OF THE STUDY**\n\nThis study will not benefit you directly. It may help others in the future by learning what germs make people sick.\n\n**SOURCE OF FUNDING**\n\nThe University of Washington is receiving financial support from an anonymous donor.\n\n**CONFIDENTIALITY OF RESEARCH INFORMATION**\n\nYour record will be kept secret. You will not be identified in any report about this study. All records will be kept in a secure location at the University of Washington. Your study record will never be used against you.\n\nGovernment and university staff sometimes review studies such as this one to make sure they are being done safely and legally. If a review of this study takes place, your records may be examined. The reviewers will protect your privacy. The study records will never be used against you.\n\nWashington State law requires that we report certain conditions to local public health jurisdictions or the Department of Health. If your sample tests positive for one of these conditions, a local health jurisdiction or the Department of Health might contact you with more questions. They will keep your information secret.\n\n**SPECIMEN BANKING**\n\nStoring samples so researchers can use them in the future is called “banking.” Researchers also bank information and samples so they can share it with other researchers.\n\nThe information and/or samples that we obtain from you for this study might be used for future studies. We may remove anything that might identify you from the information and samples. If we do so, that information and samples may then be used for future research studies or given to another researcher without getting additional permission from you. It is also possible that in the future we may want to use or share study information that might identify you. If we do, a review board will decide whether or not we need to get additional permission from you.\n\nBy signing this consent form, you are giving your permission for these researchers to use your sample for future use.\n\n**OTHER INFORMATION**\n\nYou may refuse to participate and you are free to leave this study at any time without penalty or loss of benefits to which you are otherwise entitled (such as your normal medical care). By signing this form, you do not give up any of your rights.\n\nIf you join this study, you will receive a $10 gift card for each nose swab that we collect. You will receive the gift card the same day that we collect the sample.\n\n**RESEARCH-RELATED INJURY**\n\nIf you think you have been harmed from being in this research, contact Dr.Helen Y. Chu at (206) 897-5318. The University of Washington does not normally provide compensation for harm except through its discretionary program for medical industry. However, the law may allow you to seek other compensation if the harm is the fault of the researchers. You do not waive any right to seek payment by signing this consent form.\n\n**Subject's statement**\n\nThis study has been explained to me. I volunteer to take part in this research. I have had a chance to ask questions. If I have questions later about the research, or if I have been harmed by participating in this study, I can contact one of the researchers listed on the first page of this consent form. If I have questions about my rights as a research subject, I can call the Human Subjects Division at (206) 543-0098 or call collect at (206) 221-5940. I will receive a copy of this consent form."

Questions: A person on the research team would ask you and/or your parents some questions. You or your parents do not have to answer any question you don’t want to.\n2. Nasal swab: We would take a little bit of snot from your nose by putting a swab (Q-tip) in your nose and twirling it around.\n\nThe nose swab test might hurt just a little bit. It might make you feel like you have to sneeze or cough. Some of the questions might make you uncomfortable. You do not have to answer any question you don’t want to.\n\nThis research will not help you.

Remember, being in this study is up to you and no one will be upset if you don’t want to participate or even if you change your mind later and want to stop.\n\nYou can ask any questions about the study. If you have a question later you can call a researcher at (206) 897-5318.\n\nSigning your name at the bottom means that you agree to be in this study.

These samples will give us more information about what kinds of antibodies (molecules that protect you against disease), you have. This helps us understand your own ability to fight certain viruses at the time the blood is obtained.\n\n**STUDY PROCEDURES**\n\nIf you agree to the participate in this optional sub-study, the study procedures will include:\n\n1. Collecting a nasal swab each day while you are in the hospital for up to 7 days\n2. Getting your blood up to 2 times while you are in the hospital (up to 50 mL)\n3. Obtaining any leftover respiratory specimens that your primary care team collected\n4. Reviewing your medical records for your medical history\n\n**RISKS, STRESS, OR DISCOMFORT**\n\nWe do not expect serious side effects from this sub-study. Like in the main study, getting the nasal swab may cause some mild discomfort, watery eyes, or sneezing. Doing a blood draw may cause mild discomfort for a short time, or rarely, a little bleeding. There are also small risks of fainting and infection from a blood draw. If you have a central catheter in place, we may be able to have a member of your clinical team draw blood from that line. If blood is left over from other studies, we may be able to use that blood.\n\n**BENEFITS OF THE SUB-STUDY**\n\nThis sub-study will not benefit you directly. It may help others in the future by helping us understand how antibodies make a difference in the type of viruses that infect people.\n\n**CONFIDENTIALITY OF RESEARCH INFORMATION**\n\nYour record will be kept confidential as described in the consent form for the main study.\n\n**OTHER INFORMATION**\n\nYou may refuse to participate and you are free to withdraw from this sub-study at any time without penalty or loss of benefits to which you are otherwise entitled. You will receive a $10 gift card for each additional specimen (nasal swab or blood draw) collected for this sub-study. This is in addition to the $10 gift card you received for the main study. Reimbursement will be provided each time a new specimen is collected from you.\n\n**Subject’s statement**\n\nThis study has been explained to me. I volunteer to take part in this research.

This does not affect your right to see what is in your medical (hospital) records.\n\nThere is no time limit for the use or sharing of your information.  Researchers continue to analyze data for many years, and it is not always possible to know when they will be done.  If your information will be banked as part of this study, it may be used in the future for other research.  We would not ask for your permission prior to this future research.\n\nYour permission for the use or sharing of your information will not expire, but you may cancel it at any time.  You can do this by notifying the study team in writing.  If you cancel your permission, no new information will be collected about you, but information that has already been collected may still be used and shared with others.\n\nThe use or sharing of your information will follow privacy laws, but these laws only apply to doctors, hospitals, and other health care providers.  Some people who receive your health information as part of this study may share it with others without your permission if doing so is permitted by the laws they must follow.\n\nIf the results of the study are published, information that identifies you would not be used.\n\nYour permission is documented by signing this form below.
