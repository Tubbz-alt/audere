# FluTrack

## Overview

FluTrack is a React Native application to collect information about the spread of flu. Participants self-report symptoms and basic demographic & location data in conjunction with specimen collection. The application relies on a backend web service to persist collected data, [FluApi](https://github.com/AudereNow/learn/tree/master/FluApi).

## Developer setup

This project shuld be installed using Yarn. Once it has been installed the application can be started using `yarn start`. Other script options are documented in the [Create React Native App docs](https://github.com/AudereNow/learn/blob/master/learn/ReactNativeTS/FluTrack/APP.md).

### FluApi

By default the local FluTrack application will talk to an instance of FluApi in an AWS staging environment. To run against a local instance of the FluApi use `yarn start-localapi`.

In order to push documents to your local API instance you will need a valid access key. This can be generated by running the command `yarn run generate-access-key` from the [FluApi](https://github.com/AudereNow/learn/tree/master/FluApi) project directory locally. The generated access key information should be placed in your .env file.

## Expo

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React Native App](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app) and is deployed using Expo.

For more details about working with Create React Native App refer to the [app documentation](https://github.com/AudereNow/learn/blob/master/learn/ReactNativeTS/FluTrack/APP.md).
