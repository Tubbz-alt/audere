    "consentFormText": "UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON\nCONSENT FORM: Ages 18 and up\nASSENT FORM:  Ages 13-17\n\nRespiratory Virus Surveillance in an Urban Setting\n\nResearchers: \tMichael Boeckh, MD, PhD, Professor or Medicine, Allergy and Infectious Diseases, University of Washington; \n\t\t\tHelen Chu, MD, MPH, Assistant Professor of Medicine, Allergy and Infectious Diseases, University of Washington; \n\t\t\tJanet Englund, MD, Professor, Pediatric Infectious Disease, Seattle Children's Hospital\n\nResearchers' statement\nWe are asking you to be in a research study.  The purpose of this consent form is to give you the information you will need to help you decide whether to be in the study or not.  Please read the form carefully.  You may ask questions about the purpose of the research, what we would ask you to do, the possible risks and benefits, your rights as a volunteer, and anything else about the research or this form that is not clear.  When we have answered all your questions, you can decide if you want to be in the study or not.  This process is called “informed consent.”  You have the option to receive a copy of this consent electronically.\n\nPotential Teen Participants:  This form also serves as an assent form.  That means that if you choose to take part in this research study, you would sign this form to confirm your choice.  Your parent or legally authorized representative would also need to give their permission and sign this form for you to join the study.    \n\nThis document is also used for parents or legally-authorized representatives of subjects to provide permission to the research team for individuals who are not capable of providing permission themselves.  In such cases, the terms “you” refers to the subject or your child.\n\n \nPURPOSE OF THE STUDY\nThe goal of this study is to determine the rate and spread of respiratory viruses in an urban area. Respiratory viruses commonly infect adults and children. Infection is usually mild in healthy adults and children, leading to runny noses, coughing, and wheezing.  However, infection can become more serious, especially in older and very young people and those with lung diseases or weak immune systems.  \n\nThe samples collected will be used to detect any respiratory viruses that are in your body.\n\nSTUDY PROCEDURES\nYou are being invited to join this study you are experiencing the symptoms of a respiratory virus. If you join this study, participating in this study will include:\n\nSurvey\nAt the beginning of the study we will ask you some questions about your basic demographics (such as age, race, ethnicity, etc.), your family, your health, and your home.  We think these questions will take about 15 minutes to answer. You are free to refuse to answer any of these questions \n\nWe may also ask you questions about whether you would be willing to do things in future studies, such as getting your own nasal swab or wearing a device like a fitbit to see where you go during the day.  We would not be asking you to do these things as part of this study but asking you if you might be willing to do it another time.\n\n\nNasal swabs\nWe will collect a nasal swab one-time. We would collect a nasal swab by gently putting a swab (like a Q-tip) into your nose and gently turning it around.\n\nIf you are an adult, we might also ask you if you have willing to have another nasal swab collected that you would collect yourself using a kit provided by the study.\n\n\nMedical records\nIf you are in the hospital or clinic when you join the study, reviewing your medical record for lung infections or other medical history.  We are asking for your permission to review your medical records for lung illness and other medical conditions that could have contributed to your respiratory viral infection.  \n\nRISKS, STRESS, OR DISCOMFORT\nWe do not expect serious side effects from this study.  Getting the nasal swab may cause some mild discomfort, watery eyes, or sneezing.  Some of the questions in this questionnaire are sensitive and may make you feel uncomfortable. You do not have to answer any question you do not want to.  There is a risk that your confidentiality or privacy could be breached.  This would mean that someone other the research team or our collaborators might find out that you were in the research or see your answers or medical information. However, we will take every precaution to make sure that this does not happen.\n\nBENEFITS OF THE STUDY\nThis study will not benefit you directly.  It may help others in the future by learning which respiratory viruses make people ill and how they spread.  \n\nSOURCE OF FUNDING\nThis study is funded by the Brotman Baty Institute at the University of Washington.\n\nCONFIDENTIALITY OF RESEARCH INFORMATION\nYour record will be kept confidential.  You will not be identified in any report or publication about this study.  All records will be kept in locked files at either the University of Washington or Seattle Children's Hospital.\nGovernment or university staff sometimes review studies such as this one to make sure they are being done safely and legally.  If a review of this study takes place, your records may be examined.  The reviewers will protect your privacy.  The study records will not be used to put you at legal risk of harm.\n\nOTHER INFORMATION\nYou may refuse to participate and you are free to withdraw from this study at any time without penalty or loss of benefits to which you are otherwise entitled.\nWe will send you the results of your viral testing within 1 month of sample collection. \nIf you join the study when you have symptoms of a respiratory virus and agree to have a nasal swab collected and answer our questions, you will receive a $10 gift card for participating in this study.  \nIf you are attending a daycare participating in the study, you will receive a $10 gift card for participating in this study and agree to have a nasal swab collected. For people getting more than one nasal swab, they will also receive a $10 gift card for each nasal swab/questionnaire collected, at the end of the study.  \nReimbursement will be received either the day you join the study or will be sent to you within 2 weeks.\n\nSPECIMEN BANKING\nStoring samples so researchers can use it in the future is called “banking.” Researchers also bank information/samples so they can share it with other researchers. Your sample would be stored after the completion of the study and may be used for future research. Your sample will only be labeled with a study code and will not be labeled with your name or other identifying information.  We would not be able to give you the results from research that is done using your sample. \nStorage and Use of Specimens for Research:\n \nLeftover samples are often available after testing and this consent form asks whether you allow any leftover samples to be used for future research.\n \nThis research will not be done to help you and you will not be compensated for allowing this research use of your samples. The use of leftover samples for research may lead to the development of commercial products. You will not be paid if this happens. If we want to use your samples for other research or share it with other scientists for research, an ethics review committee (IRB) would review the request. The IRB would decide if we need to ask for your consent to do the research.\n \nBy signing this consent form you are giving your permission for these researchers to use your samples for future use.             \n \n\n\nRESEARCH-RELATED INJURY\nIf you think you have been harmed from being in this research, contact {{name}}, {{phone}}.  The UW does not normally provide compensation for harm except through its discretionary program for medical injury. However, the law may allow you to seek other compensation if the harm is the fault of the researchers. You do not waive any right to seek payment by signing this consent form.” \n\nSubject's statement\nThis study has been explained to me.  I volunteer to take part in this research.  I have had a chance to ask questions.  If I have questions later about the research, or if I have been harmed by participating in this study, I can contact one of the researchers listed on the first page of this consent form.  If I have questions about my rights as a research subject, I can call the Human Subjects Division at (206) 543-0098 or call collect at (206) 221-5940.  I give permission to the researchers to use my medical records as described in this consent form.  I will receive a copy of this consent form.\n",

You or your parents do not have to answer any question you don’t want to.\nNasal swab: We would take a little bit of snot from your nose by putting a swab (Q-tip) in your nose and twirling it around. \nMedical records: If you are in the hospital when you join the study, we will look at your past doctor visits and use information about your care for our research.\nThe nose swab test might hurt just a little bit. It might make you feel like you have to sneeze or cough. Some of the questions might make you uncomfortable. You do not have to answer any question you don’t want to. \nThis research will not help you.  We do hope to learn something from this research though.  \nPlease talk this over with your parents before you decide whether or not to do this. We will also ask your parents if it is okay for you to be in this study. But even if your parents say “yes” you can still decide not to do this.\nIf you don’t want to be in the study, you don’t have to participate. Remember, being in this study is up to you and no one will be upset if you don’t want to participate or even if you change your mind later and want to stop.\nYou can ask any questions about the study. If you have a question later you can call me [insert your telephone number] or ask me next time. \nSigning your name at the bottom means that you agree to be in this study. You and your parents will be given a copy of this form after you have signed it.\n\n\nYour statement:\nThis research has been explained to me. I agree to take part in this study.

For this sub-study we would like to collect additional optional samples from adults who are hospitalized with symptoms of a respiratory virus. These samples will give us more information about what kinds of antibodies (molecules that protect you against disease), you have.  This helps us understand your own ability to fight certain viruses at the time the blood is obtained. \nSTUDY PROCEDURES\nIf you agree to the optional sub-study, the study procedures will include:\nCollecting a nasal swab each day while you are in the hospital for up to 7 days\nGetting your blood up to 2 times while you are in the hospital  (up to 50 mL)\n\nRISKS, STRESS, OR DISCOMFORT\nWe do not expect serious side effects from this sub-study.  Like in the main study, getting the nasal swab may cause some mild discomfort, watery eyes, or sneezing.  Doing a blood draw may cause mild discomfort for a short time, or rarely, a little bleeding. If you have a central catheter in place, we may be able to have a health care person draw blood from that line.  If blood is left over from other studies we may be able to use that blood.\n\nBENEFITS OF THE SUB-STUDY\nThis sub-study will not benefit you directly.  It may help others in the future by helping us understand how antibodies make a difference in the type of viruses that infect people.    \n\nCONFIDENTIALITY OF RESEARCH INFORMATION\nYour record will be kept confidential as described in the consent form for the main study.  \n\nOTHER INFORMATION\nYou may refuse to participate and you are free to withdraw from this sub-study at any time without penalty or loss of benefits to which you are otherwise entitled.
