Help us undo the flu. 

Our overall goal is to reduce the number of people who get sick with this frustrating illness. You can help us understand the flu in your community by becoming one of our study participants. At the same time, you'll be one of the first to try a special flu test conducted from the comfort of home.

You may be eligible to participate if you live in Australia, are 18 years of age or older, and visit a GP participating in the ASPREN study who determines you are experiencing cold or flu-like symptoms.

How it works:

- Visit your GP. If your GP participates in the ASPREN study and determines you have flu-like symptoms you may be offered a flu@home test kit. 
- Take the kit home and download the flu@home app. The app will walk you through each step. 
- Complete the test, which involves swabbing just inside the tip of your nose. 
- Answer questions about your illness and use the app to scan your test strip.
- The app will guide you through interpreting the result of your test.  

Your participation could have a huge impact on how we manage the flu in the future.
