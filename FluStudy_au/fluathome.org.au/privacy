</span></span><b><span>To allow us to
share your Personal Information for our own and other research purposes</span></b></p>

<p><span>Once you have consented to participate in our Research Study,
any information provided by you may be used in the study and unidentified
information may be used in other research aimed at publication in peer-reviewed
journals conducted by us or third parties as described in the Consent Form.</span></p>

<p><span>Our research may be sponsored by, conducted on behalf of,
or in collaboration with third parties, such as non-profit foundations,
academic institutions or pharmaceutical companies. &nbsp;Our research may study
a specific group or population, identify potential areas or targets for

<p><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>i.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span>Your&nbsp;Personal

as we are not collecting Registration Information for this study.</span></p>

<p><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>ii.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span>We may share summary

<h2><span>4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span>Information we share with third parties</span></h2>

<p><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><b><span>General service
providers.</span></b></p>

<p><span>We share the information described above in Section 2 with
our third party service providers, as necessary for them to provide their
services to us and help us perform our research. Service providers are third
parties (other companies or individuals) that help us to provide, analyze and
improve our Services. While we directly conduct the majority of data processing
activities required for our Research Study, we engage some third party service
providers to assist in supporting our Research Study, including in the
following areas:</span></p>

<p><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>i.</span><b><span>Human Research
Ethics Committee support.</span></b><span>&nbsp;Our
Human Research Ethics Committee uses a number of tools to help organize and
manage the requests we receive. These tools help to ensure we provide timely,
high quality support.</span></p>

<p><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>ii.</span><b><span>Cloud storage,
IT, and Security.</span></b><span>&nbsp;Our
cloud storage providers provide secure storage for information in our
databases, ensure that our infrastructure can support continued use of our data
by researchers, and protect data in the event of a natural disaster or other
disruption to the Service. Our IT and security providers assist with intrusion
detection and prevention measures to stop any potential attacks against our
networks. We have these third party experts perform penetration tests and
periodically audit our security controls.</span></p>

<p><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>iii.</span><b><span>Marketing and
analytics.</span></b><span>&nbsp;When
you use our Services, including our website or mobile app(s), our third party
service providers may collect Web-Behavior Information about your visit, such
as the links you clicked on, the duration of your visit, and the URLs you visited.
This information can help us improve site navigability and assess our marketing
campaigns. Per applicable data protection regulations, our EU, UK, and
International websites present visitors with a cookie opt in to allow the
processing described above via Functionality and Advertising Cookies.</span></p>

<p><span>NOTE: Our service providers act on our behalf. We implement
procedures and maintain contractual terms with each service provider to protect
the confidentiality and security of your information. However, we cannot guarantee
the confidentiality and security of your information due to the inherent risks
associated with storing and transmitting data electronically.</span></p>

<p><span>b.<span>&nbsp; </span></span><b><span>Aggregate information</span></b></p>

<p><span>We may share Aggregate Information, which is information that
is unidentified and combined with information of others so that you cannot
reasonably be identified as an individual, with third parties. This Information
is different from Individual-level Information and is not Personal Information
because it does not identify any particular individual or disclose any
particular individual’s data. For example, Aggregate Information may include a
statement that &quot;30% of our research participants correctly self-identified
their flu symptoms&quot; without providing any data or testing results specific
to any individual user. In contrast, Individual-level&nbsp;<span>Self-Reported Information</span>&nbsp;consists of data
about a single individual's health status or other traits/characteristics
information.  </span></p>

<p><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><b><span>As required by law</span></b></p>

<p><span>Under certain circumstances your Personal Information may
be subject to processing pursuant to applicable laws, regulations, judicial or
other government subpoenas, warrants, or orders. For example, we may be
required to disclose Personal Information in coordination with regulatory
authorities in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to
meet national security or law enforcement requirements. We will preserve and
disclose any and all information to law enforcement agencies or others if
required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such preservation or
disclosure is reasonably necessary to: (a) comply with legal or regulatory
process (such as a judicial proceeding, court order, or government inquiry) or
obligations that we may owe pursuant to ethical and other professional rules,
laws, and regulations; (b) enforce our&nbsp;rights under the EULA&nbsp;and
other policies; (c) respond to claims that any content violates the rights of
third parties; or (d) protect the rights, property, or personal safety of the University
of Adelaide, UW Institute, Audere, their respective employees, users, clients,
and the public. </span></p>

<p><span>d.<span>&nbsp; </span></span><b><span>Business transactions</span></b></p>

<p><span>In the event that Audere goes through a business transition
such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of all or a portion of
its assets your Personal Information will likely be among the assets
transferred. In such a case, your information would remain subject to the
promises made in any pre-existing Privacy Statement<span>.</span></span></p>

<h2><span>5.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span>Withdrawing your Consent</span></h2>

<p><span>Participation
in this project is completely voluntary. If you agree to participate by
agreeing to the Consent Form in the flu@home App, anonymous data will be
collected based on your interactions with the application. It will not be
possible to withdraw your unidentified data once collected. </span></p>

<p><b><span>What happens
if you do NOT consent to participate in our Research Study?</span></b><span>&nbsp;If you choose not to complete the <span>Consent Form </span>or any additional agreement with
us, you will not be required to complete the home testing kit, and your
Personal Information will not be used for our research.</span></p>

<h2><span>6.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span>Security measures</span></h2>

<p><span>We take seriously the trust you place in
us. We implement physical, technical, and administrative measures to prevent
unauthorized access to or disclosure of your information, to maintain data
accuracy, to ensure the appropriate use of information, and otherwise safeguard
your Personal Information.</span></p>

<p><span>●<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><b><span>We produce secure applications by
design.</span></b><span>&nbsp;We
incorporate explicit security reviews in the software development lifecycle,
quality assurance testing and operational deployment.</span></p>

<p><span>●<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><b><span>Unidentification/Pseudonymization.</span></b><span>&nbsp;Self-Reported Information is
stripped from Sensitive Information and stored in a separate location. This
data is then assigned a randomly generated ID so an individual cannot
reasonably be identified.</span></p>

<p><span>●<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><b><span>Encryption.</span></b><span>&nbsp;We use industry standard security
measures to encrypt Sensitive Information both at rest and in transit.</span></p>

<p><span>●<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><b><span>Separation of Environments.</span></b><span>&nbsp;We ensure processing, production,
and research environments are separated and access is restricted. Data, including
Registration Information and Self-Reported Information are segmented across
logical database systems to further prevent re-identifiability.</span></p>

<p><span>●<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><b><span>Limiting access to essential personnel.</span></b><span>&nbsp;We limit access to Personal
Information to authorized personnel, based on job function and role. Our access
controls include multi-factor authentication.</span></p>

<p><span>●<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><b><span>Detecting threats and managing
vulnerabilities.</span></b><span>&nbsp;We
have a vulnerability disclosure program (https://auderenow.org/security), and
also have vulnerability scanning in our codebase using automated tools that
detect new vulnerabilities that we then patch.</span></p>

<p><span>●<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><b><span>Managing third party service providers.</span></b><span>&nbsp; We require service providers to
implement and maintain accepted industry standard administrative, physical and
technical safeguards to protect Personal Information.</span></p>

<p><b><span>Your Responsibility.</span></b><span>&nbsp;Please recognize that protecting
your Personal Information is also your responsibility. You should not share
your flu@home App with others to whom you do not wish to give access to your
Personal Information.  We cannot secure Personal Information that you release
on your own or that you request us to release.</span></p>

<p><span>Your information collected through the
Service may be stored and processed in the United States or any other country
in which Audere or their respective subsidiaries, affiliates or service
providers maintain facilities and, therefore, your information may be subject
to the laws of those other jurisdictions which may be different from the laws
of your country of residence.</span></p>

<h2><span>7.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span>Children's privacy</span></h2>

<p><span>We are committed to protecting the
privacy of children as well as adults. Neither our Research Study nor any of
our Services are designed for, intended to attract, or directed toward children
under the age of 18. </span></p>

<h2><span>8.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span>Linked websites</span></h2>

<p><span>We provide links to third party websites
operated by organizations not affiliated with us. We do not disclose your
information to organizations operating such linked third party websites. We do
not review or endorse, and are not responsible for, the privacy practices of
these organizations. We encourage you to read the privacy statements of each
and every website that you visit. This Privacy Statement applies solely to
information collected by us and our service providers on our behalf.</span></p>

<h2><span>9.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span>Information for Customers in Designated
Countries</span></h2>

<p><span>Section 9 only applies to individuals
located in the European Economic Area (“<b>EEA</b>”), United Kingdom, or
Switzerland (the “<b>Designated Countries</b>”).  We aim to take reasonable
steps to allow you to correct, amend, delete or limit the use of your personal data.</span></p>

<p><span>If
you wish to be informed about what personal data we hold about you and if you
want it to be removed from our systems, please <span>contact
us</span> at flu-support-au@auderenow.org.</span></p>

<p><span>In
certain circumstances, you have the following data protection rights:</span></p>

<p><b><span>The right to access, update
or delete the information we have on you.</span></b><span> This can be done by contacting us at flu-support-au@auderenow.org.</span></p>

<p><b><span>The right of rectification.</span></b><span> You may have your

about our collection and use of your personal data. For more information,
please contact your local data protection authority in the EEA.</span></p>

<p><span>The rights described above may be limited by local laws.
Further, your right of access and deletion is not absolute and may not be
available if fulfillment of such right would, among other things:</span></p>

<p><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>o<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span>cause interference with execution and
