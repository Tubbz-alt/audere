    "++tip3": "Antibiotics wonât help your cold or flu. Antibiotics fight infections caused by bacteria, but colds and flu are caused by viruses.\n",
    "++tip4": "On average, about 8% of the U.S. population gets sick from flu each season.\n",
    "++tip5": "Most experts believe that flu viruses spread mainly by tiny droplets made when people with flu cough, sneeze or talk. These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby.\n",
    "++tip6": "Complications of flu can include bacterial pneumonia, ear infections, sinus infections and worsening of chronic medical conditions, such as congestive heart failure, asthma, or diabetes.\n",
    "++tip7": "Flu antiviral drugs work best for treatment when they are started within 2 days of getting sick.\n",
    "++tip8": "Everyday preventive actions (like staying away from people who are sick, covering coughs and sneezes, and frequent handwashing) help slow the spread of germs that cause the flu.\n",
