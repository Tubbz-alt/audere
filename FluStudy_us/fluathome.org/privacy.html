    </li>
    <li><b>To share your Personal Information for other research purposes to which you have separately 
        consented</b>
        <p>If you have consented to participate in a research study that will utilize flu@home, any 
            information provided by you through the flu@home application and related sample kit may 
            be used to meet the defined goals of that study, and de-identified information may be used 
            in other research aimed at publication in peer-reviewed journals conducted by us or by 
            third parties.</p>
        <p>Our research may be sponsored by, conducted on behalf of, or in collaboration with third 
            parties, such as non-profit foundations, academic institutions or pharmaceutical companies.  
            Our research may study a specific group or population, identify potential areas or targets

                de-identified and will not be linked to your Personally Identifiable Information.</li>
            <li>We may share summary statistics, which do not identify any particular individual or 
                contain individual-level information, with our qualified research collaborators.</li>
        </ol>
        <p><b>Withdrawing your Consent.</b>You may withdraw your consent for us to use your Personal 
            Information as described in this Privacy Statement at any time by contacting us at 
            support@auderenow.org. Any research involving your data that has already been performed

            you have chosen to participate in our research study and have opted to receive information 
            about related studies, we (or other researchers involved in this study) may send you an 
            email informing you of our additional research opportunities for which you may be eligible. 
            However we will not share Individual-level Personal Health Information with any third party 
            without your consent. If you do not wish to receive these notifications, you may contact us 
            at support@auderenow.org.</p></li>
    <li><b>To provide user support</b>
    <p>When you contact us, we may use or request Personal Information, including Personal Health

        </p></li>
</ol>


<h4>4. Information we share with third parties</h4>

<ol class="uppercase-alpha-list">
    <li><b>General service providers.</b>
    <p>We share the information described above in Section 2 with our third party service 
        providers, as necessary for them to provide their services to us and help us perform 
        our research. Service providers are third parties (other companies or individuals) 
        that help us to provide, analyze and improve our Services. While we directly conduct 
        the majority of data processing activities required for our research study, we engage 
        some third party service providers to assist in supporting our Research, including in 
        the following areas:</p>
        <ol class="roman-list">
            <li><b>Cloud storage, IT, and Security.</b> Our cloud storage providers provide 
                secure storage for information in our databases, ensure that our infrastructure 
                can support continued use of our data by researchers, and protect data in the 
                event of a natural disaster or other disruption to the Service. Our IT and 
                security providers assist with intrusion detection and prevention measures to 
                stop any potential attacks against our networks. We have these third party experts 
                perform penetration tests and periodically audit our security controls.</li>
            <li><b>Marketing and analytics.</b> When you use our Services, including our website 
                or mobile app(s), our third party service providers may collect Web-Behavior 
                Information about your visit, such as the links you clicked on, the duration of 
                your visit, and the URLs you visited. This information can help us improve site 
                navigability and assess our Marketing campaigns. Per applicable data protection 
                regulations, our EU, UK, and International websites present visitors with a cookie 
                opt in to allow the processing described above via Functionality and Advertising 
                Cookies.
            <p>NOTE: Our service providers act on our behalf. We implement procedures and maintain 
                contractual terms with each service provider to protect the confidentiality and 
                security of your information. However, we cannot guarantee the confidentiality and 
                security of your information due to the inherent risks associated with storing and 
                transmitting data electronically.</p></li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li><b>Sponsors of studies in which you have consented to participate</b>  
        <p>If you are using the flu@home application in connection with a third-party sponsored 
            study in which you have consented to participate, your Personal Information and 
            Personally Identifiable Information may be used in such study in accordance with the 
            terms of the study. For example, if a study combines certain Personally Identifiable 
            Information such as physical activity levels, sleep patterns or other metrics together 
            with the results of a test kit processed by using the flu@home application, your Personally 
            Identifiable information may be provided to the study sponsors in order to pair your flu@home 
            test results with other Personal Information provided by you. 
            </p></li>
    <li><b>Aggregate information</b>  
        <p>We may share Aggregate Information, which is information that has been stripped of your 
            name and contact information and combined with information of others so that you cannot 
            reasonably be identified as an individual, with third parties. This Information is different 
            from "Individual-level" information and is not Personal Information because it does not 
            identify any particular individual or disclose any particular individual’s data. For 
            example, Aggregate Information may include a statement that "30% of our research subjects 
            correctly self-identified their flu symptoms," without providing any data or testing results 
            specific to any individual user. In contrast, Individual-level Personal Health Information 
            consists of data about a single individual's health status or other traits/characteristics 
            information. 
            </p></li>
    <li><b>As required by law</b>  
        <p>Under certain circumstances your Personal Information may be subject to processing pursuant 
            to laws, regulations, judicial or other government subpoenas, warrants, or orders. For 
            example, we may be required to disclose Personal Information in coordination with 
            regulatory authorities in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to 
            meet national security or law enforcement requirements. We will preserve and disclose any 
            and all information to law enforcement agencies or others if required to do so by law or in 
            the good faith belief that such preservation or disclosure is reasonably necessary to: (a) 
            comply with legal or regulatory process (such as a judicial proceeding, court order, or 
            government inquiry) or obligations that we may owe pursuant to ethical and other professional 
            rules, laws, and regulations; (b) enforce our rights under the EULA and other policies; (c) 
            respond to claims that any content violates the rights of third parties; or (d) protect the 
            rights, property, or personal safety of Audere, their respective employees, users, clients, 
            and the public. 
            </p></li>
    <li><b>Business transactions</b>  
        <p>In the event that Audere goes through a business transition such as a merger, acquisition 
            by another company, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, your Personal Information 
            will likely be among the assets transferred. In such a case, your information would remain 
            subject to the promises made in any pre-existing Privacy Statement.
            </p></li>
</ol>

<h4>5. Security measures</h4>

<p>We take seriously the trust you place in us. We implement physical, technical, 
and administrative measures to prevent unauthorized access to or disclosure of your 
information, to maintain data accuracy, to ensure the appropriate use of information, 
and otherwise safeguard your Personal Information.</p>

<ul>
    <li><b>We produce secure applications by design.</b> We incorporate explicit 
        security reviews in the software development lifecycle, quality assurance 
        testing and operational deployment.</li>
    <li><b>De-identification/Pseudonymization.</b> Personally Identifiable Information 
        is stripped from Personal Health Information before being shared with study 
        partners as de-identified information. All de-identified information is referenced 
        using a randomly generated ID. </li>
    <li><b>Encryption.</b> We use industry standard security measures to encrypt all 
        Personally Identifiable Information and Personal Health Information both at rest 
        and in transit. </li>
    <li><b>Separation of Environments.</b> We ensure test, production, and research 
        environments are separated and access is restricted. Data, including Personally 
        Identifiable Information and Personal Health Information are segmented across 
        logical database systems to further prevent re-identifiability.</li>
    <li><b>Limiting access to essential personnel.</b> We limit access to Personal 
        Information to authorized personnel, based on job function and role. Our access 
        controls include multi-factor authentication.</li>
    <li><b>Detecting threats and managing vulnerabilities.</b> We have a vulnerability 
        disclosure program (https://auderenow.org/security), and also have vulnerability 
        scanning in our codebase using automated tools that detect new vulnerabilities that 
        we then patch.</li>
    <li><b>Managing third party service providers. </b> We require service providers to 
        implement and maintain accepted industry standard administrative, physical and 
        technical safeguards to protect Personal Information.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Your Responsibility.</b> Please recognize that protecting your Personal Information is 
also your responsibility. You should not share your flu@home application with others to 
whom you do not wish to give access to your Personal Information.  We cannot secure 
Personal Information that you release on your own or that you request us to release.</p>

<p>Your information collected through the Service may be stored and processed in the 
United States or any other country in which the Audere or their respective subsidiaries, 
affiliates or service providers maintain facilities and, therefore, your information may 
be subject to the laws of those other jurisdictions which may be different from the laws 
of your country of residence.</p>

<h4>6. Children's privacy</h4>

<p>We are committed to protecting the privacy of children as well as adults. 
Neither the research study nor any of our Services are designed for, intended 
to attract, or directed toward children under the age of 18.  We will not knowingly 
collect Personal Information from any child under the age of 18. We ask that minors 
(under the age of 18) not use the flu@home application. If a child under the age of 
18 has provided us with Personal Information, a parent or guardian of that child 
may contact us and request that such information be deleted from our records.</p>

<h4>7. Linked websites</h4>

<p>We provide links to third party websites operated by organizations not affiliated 
with us. We do not disclose your information to organizations operating such linked third 
party websites. We do not review or endorse, and are not responsible for the privacy 
practices of these organizations. We encourage you to read the privacy statements of each 
and every website that you visit. This Privacy Statement applies solely to information 
collected by us and our service providers on our behalf.</p>

<h4>8. Information for Customers in Designated Countries</h4>

<p>Section 8 only applies to individuals located in the European Economic Area (“EEA”),
United Kingdom, or Switzerland (the “Designated Countries”).  We aim to take reasonable 
steps to allow you to correct, amend, delete or limit the use of your personal data.</p>

<p>If you wish to be informed about what personal data we hold about you and if you want 
it to be removed from our systems, please contact us at 
<a href="mailto:support@auderenow.org">support@auderenow.org</a></p>

<p>In certain circumstances, you have the following data protection rights:</p>

<p><b>The right to access, update or delete the information we have on you. </b>
This can be done by contacting us at 
<a href="mailto:support@auderenow.org">support@auderenow.org</a></p>

<p><b>The right of rectification. </b>You may have your information corrected 
if it is inaccurate or incomplete.</p>

<p><b>The right to object.</b>You have the right to ask us to discontinue our 
processing of your personal data.</p>

<p><b>The right of restriction.</b>You are entitled to request that we restrict 
the processing of your personal information.</p>

<p><b>The right to withdraw consent.</b>This involves withdrawing your consent 
at any time where we previously relied on it to process your personal information.</p>

<p>Please note that we may ask you to verify your identity before responding to 
such requests.</p>

<p>You have the right to complain to a Data Protection Authority about our collection 
and use of your personal data. For more information, please contact your local data 
protection authority in the European Economic Area (EEA).</p>

<p>The rights described above may be limited by local laws. Further, your right of 
access and deletion is not absolute and may not be available if fulfillment of such 
right would, among other things:</p>

<ul class="bulleted-list">
    <li>cause interference with execution and enforcement of the law and legal private 
        rights (such as in the case of the investigation or detection of legal claims or the right 
        to a fair trial);</li>
    <li>breach or prejudice the rights of confidentiality and security of others;</li>
    <li>prejudice security or grievance investigations, corporate re-organizations, future and 
        ongoing negotiations with third parties, the compliance with regulatory requirements relating 
        to economic and financial management; or</li>
    <li>otherwise violate the interests of others or where the burden or cost of providing access 
        would be disproportionate.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Complaints</b></p>

<p>If you believe that we have infringed your rights, we encourage you to contact us so that we can 
try to address your concerns or dispute informally. </p>
